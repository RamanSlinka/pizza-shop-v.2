                    Usually people come to Dodo Pizza just to eat. Our promoters distribute leaflets about a slice of
                    pizza
                    for twenty rubles or something else profitable. We do this as the first step to get to know each
                    other.

                    But for us, Dodo is not only pizza. This is pizza too, but first of all it is a big business that
                    inspires us, makes us wake up every morning and continue to work with interest.

                    What is our interest? Let's tell you now.

                <p>
                    Why are we so eager to get to know each other? Because then the pizza does everything by itself.
                    People see that it tastes good and come back again. The main thing for us is to show it for the
                    first time.

                    In general, pizza is a very simple thing, it is difficult to spoil it. Enough good ingredients and
                    correct dough. This is a constructor, if the parts are of high quality, then the result will be
                    fine. Here are our details:

                        <h2>Dough</h2>
                        <p>The most subtle thing. The main thing is to make it "alive".
                            This is a whole quest of grams, degrees, percentages and hours and minutes.
                            The process is not easy, but we succeed!</p>

                        <h2>Mozzarella</h2>
                        <p>
                            Pizza cheese is a key ingredient.
                            We use real mozzarella from Russian suppliers.
                            The cheese should stretch like in the picture.

                        <h2>Filling</h2>
                        <p>
                            There are two main rules for a tasty filling:
                            do not skimp on the filling;
                            fanatically observe the storage regime.
                            This is the whole secret.

                        <h2>Tomato sauce</h2>
                        <p>
                            The main thing to know about a good tomato sauce is that
                            it must be made from tomatoes.
                            Sounds logical, but think about it!
